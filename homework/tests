Homework after tests-lecture:
1. write unit tests for:
 test_simple_calc.py + test_simple_employee.py
2. if you want more challenge, write tests for test_complex.py
Use SetUp, TearDown methods, Mock(), patch etc.
Note: pay attention to names of test methods, and make sure each method tests one thing only!


Homework after tests-practice:
1. Experiment with pytest run - run it over all the lectures/tests package, run some particular test module,
run some test class/test case
2. Get to know what is test coverage (https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
and check code coverage for your tests - try to increase the coverage for your unit tests as much as possible.
https://www.simform.com/test-coverage/ - if you want to know more about test coverage.
3. Add all the needed tests for hen_house.hen_class.HenHouse (you can add even more than described)
with unittest syntax to test_hen_class.py
If you want more challenge, add test_hen_class_pytest.py where no unittest.TestCase should be used,
just pure asserts and pytest functions. (run it with pytest then)
Check tests coverage.
